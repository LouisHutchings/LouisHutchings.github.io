## PROJECTS

Library Web Application- Designed, developed and deployed full stack Web application created
for a society at the university that allows the user to view the societies library and borrow and return
books. Built using Python (Django)/HTML/CSS/Javascript/SQLite. The project involved working
closely with the client from initial ideas right the way through to deployment.

SkillScreener (University Project)- SkillScreener is a job applications tool created for Deutsche
Bank that uses machine learning to decide whether, based on their CV, a candidate should be rejected
or invited to interview. The application also included a website for users to apply to Deutsche Bank
jobs and an admin portal for Duetsche Bank employees to view job applications and data analytics.
The final product was pitched to Deutsche Bank and received a first.

Multi-threaded packet parsing application (University Project)- Built an application in C
which parses packets coming in on the network to check for malicious activity. Used multi-threading
to handle the high throughput of packets. To improve performance, a custom threadpool was created
in order to eliminate the overhead of creating new threads.

Billsplitter- Developed a full stack Web application using PHP/JQuery/SQLite/HTML/CSS that
allows housemates to connect and split bills. The application includes social media features such as
friend requests and activity timelines as well as the ability to settle bill payments between groups of
people.
